# practice


Description:
I have created two separate applications, each with its own set of files. The first application is a To-Do List that enables you to input tasks (todos), mark them as completed, and delete them when they are no longer needed. The second application is a Weather App that allows you to specify a location anywhere in the world and retrieve weather information, including temperature, humidity, and cloud conditions such as overcast, broken clouds, or clear sky.

User Story:
The primary goal of these projects was to serve as experimentation and practice for enhancing my JavaScript skills.
